# Version Control #

The Version Control project is a tool that can be run from the Uniface IDE's additional menu. It synchronises your repository database with the file system so that your source code can be versioned with standard version control tools (such as Bitbucket).

## Dependencies ##
Version Control has been written and tested with:

 * Uniface 9.6.07
 * SQLite
 * Meta Tools (0.1-9.6)  - https://github.com/uniface/Development-Tooling/tree/master/uniface-meta-tools

## Setup ##

 * Download the latest zip from the downloads page
 * Unzip the download into your local Uniface packages directory. This is where you'll keep all your Uniface tooling. These instructions assume this folder is C:\\UnifacePackages\\
 * You should now have a folder called VersionControl in C:\\UnifacePackages\\, inside this folder is a number of UAR files and other folders. Version Control is now ready to be used in your projects
